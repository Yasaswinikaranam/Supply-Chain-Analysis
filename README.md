# Supply-Chain-Analysis
The project aimed to enhance operational efficiency, financial resilience, and flexibility in a simulated production environment. The simulation challenged to manage a multi-station manufacturing system by making data-driven decisions about scheduling rules, inventory management, contract selection, and throughput optimization.
Key elements of the project included:

Objective:

Achieve high throughput and minimize lead times while maintaining profitability and efficient resource utilization.
Manage bottlenecks and optimize station utilization through informed decision-making.
Scope:

Analyze operational performance by observing station utilizations, job completion rates, and lead times.
Optimize inventory through dynamic reorder points and order quantities to prevent stockouts and minimize holding costs.
Select and prioritize contracts based on revenue potential and system capacity.
Methodology:

Observation Period: An initial phase to understand baseline system performance.
Dynamic Adjustments: Iterative changes to scheduling rules, lots per order, and contract assignments to address identified bottlenecks and opportunities.
Performance Metrics: Daily throughput, lead times, revenue generation, cash flow, and station utilization.
Decisions and Rationale:

Alternating between FIFO and priority-based scheduling at Station 2 to balance workload and responsiveness.
Focusing on Contract 2 to provide stable revenue and meet manageable lead times.
Adjusting reorder quantities to balance material costs and cash flow while avoiding stockouts.
Through these strategic interventions, the team successfully balanced operational performance and financial outcomes in a complex, dynamic system.

Project Conclusion
The simulation project provided Team4 with valuable insights into operational and financial optimization within a manufacturing environment. By leveraging observation periods and making data-driven adjustments, the team effectively balanced competing objectives of throughput, lead times, and profitability.

Key Outcomes:

Operational Success:

Maintained a steady throughput of ~9 jobs/day with consistently low lead times (0.56 days), meeting contractual requirements.
Identified and mitigated bottlenecks, particularly at Station 3, through dynamic scheduling and workload redistribution.
Financial Resilience:

Generated $4,455,291 in total revenue, ending with a cash balance of $1,101,413 while remaining debt-free.
Efficient inventory management minimized disruptions and holding costs, supporting financial stability.
Strategic Insights:

Observation periods were critical for understanding system dynamics and ensuring informed decision-making.
Focused interventions on bottleneck stations and underutilized resources improved overall system flow.

Lessons Learned:

Addressing bottlenecks is essential to maximizing system throughput and revenue potential.
Observation and data analysis are invaluable tools for informed decision-making, reducing the risk of costly missteps.
Balancing competing priorities, such as operational efficiency and financial sustainability, requires strategic trade-offs.
Recommendations for Future Simulations:

Continue leveraging observation periods to establish a solid understanding of system behavior before implementing changes.
Explore opportunities for capacity expansion or redistribution to fully utilize all stations and accept higher-revenue contracts.
Provide additional guidance and best practices to future teams to accelerate learning and decision-making.
In conclusion, the simulation not only highlighted the importance of dynamic decision-making in operations management but also demonstrated the value of teamwork and adaptability in navigating complex challenges. The insights gained will inform future endeavors in similar operational optimization scenarios.
